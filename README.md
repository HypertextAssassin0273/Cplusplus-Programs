## Personal Advice
Learn advance versions of C++ (i.e. C++11/14/17) as they covers the gaps & issues we normally face in old C++. Not only this will help you to understand why & how these issues occurred & what measures were taken to prevent them, but it will also make you familiarize with other languages too. Since, at that point of time, not only C++ was getting updated with these new features but also the other languages in a bit different format, but the concepts behind them were similar. Like JavaScript, whose constructs are pretty comlpex, but a person with C++ background will have less difficulty to understand them.

Furthermore, you will be introduced with the concept of [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/@shaistha24/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming-oop-which-is-better-82172e53a526), which becomes very helpful in learning other concepts such as [Concurrent/Parallel Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jc9xFGsL8E12so1wlMS0r0hTQoJL74M). Moreover, C++11 have introduced [Move-Semantics](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners) (a.k.a [rule of five](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three)) which heavily optimizes your code. 

So, here is a great article for starters which will give you brief intro about the major differences in advance versions:
