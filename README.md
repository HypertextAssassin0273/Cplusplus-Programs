# Console & OOP based Cpp Programs

**Personal Advice:** Learn C++11 as it covers the gaps & issues we normally face in old C++. Also, it introduces [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/@shaistha24/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming-oop-which-is-better-82172e53a526), which becomes very helpful in learning [Concurrent/Parallel Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jc9xFGsL8E12so1wlMS0r0hTQoJL74M) (i.e. C++11 provides advance thread support libraries). Furthermore, C++11 have introduced [Move-Semantics](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners) (i.e. [rule of five](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three)) which heavily optimizes your code. Unlike C++14/17, it is way easier and has pretty much the same syntax as old C++, which allows you to quickly adapt its environment. Using this approach also leads you to Hybrid Programming.
